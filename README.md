# Introduction to libwing

This is a library for discovering and controlling the [Behringer
Wing](https://www.behringer.com/behringer/wing) digital mixer over the local
network. It also includes a series of utilities built using this library.

Included in this package are:

- An [Rust](https://rustlang.org) library
- C API bindings for the Rust library
- <b>wingprop:</b> A command line utility for setting and getting property values, as well as looking at property schemas
- <b>wingmon:</b> A command line utility for monitoring your Wing's properies as they change in real time.
- <b>wingschema</b>: A command line utility for generating a JSON schema of your
  Wing's properties, as well as updating a name to id mapping of Wing's
  properties. See below for more information on this mapping.

Additionally, you can find a [dart](https://dart.dev) package is also available for making Flutter apps that uses the C API.

## Usage

This library is published at crates.io, so you can add the library to your Cargo.toml using `cargo`:
```
cargo add libwing
cargo build --all-targets
```

Check out the code in the tools/ subdir for simple utilities that discovers,
connects, and do various simple things with **libwing**.

## FFI/C API

The library provides a complete C API through FFI bindings. This allows
seamless integration with existing C/C++ code while maintaining memory safety
through Rust's ownership model.

See [libwing.h](libwing.h) for the complete C API.

## [propmap.rs](src/propmap.rs), [empty-propmap.rs](src/empty-propmap.rs), and [propmap.jsonl](propmap.jsonl)

This library includes a very large mapping of property names, IDs, types, and
parent IDs in `propmap.rs`. It's over 78,000 entries and adds about 1MB to your
binary. It will also use a few MB of RAM when loaded.

The Wing's Native protocol only really deals with IDs, so if you ever want to
print a property name or look up a property ID by name, you need this mapping.
If you are happy to hard code the IDs in your code and never need to use the
names of the properties, you can disable this mapping feature.

This mapping can be generated by running the **wingschema** utility. Running
this utiltiy will create `propmap.rs` and `propmap.jsonl`. `propmap.rs` can be
copied to src/ to update the property mapping built into the library, and the
jsonl file is for your reference.

If you want to eliminate the list of name-to-ID mappings built into the code,
you can copy `empty-propmap.rs` over the `propmap.rs` included. Note, you will
break some of the utility of the utility programs if you do this. You can also
use `empty-propmap.rs` if you corrupt your `propmaprs.rs` somehow.

The default `propmap.rs` and `propmap.jsonl` included in this repo was
generated from a Wing Compact running 3.0.5 firmware and contains over 78,000
entries. **wingschema** was run with `-modify` to get the most complete schema
possible (see below).

### The dynamic nature of the Wing's properties, especially FX slots

The listing of the properties is dynamic in nature. For example, if you
have an empty FX slot 1, the children of /fx/1 will be limited to just a few
properties. But if you load an effect into that slot, now the
children of /fx/1 will be much larger. For example, /fx/1/trim only exists if
"External" is loaded into an FX slot.

**wingschema** has a parameter you can pass called `-modify` that will allow it
to cycle through all the models in each slot and request the full schema. This
will give you a more complete schema of the Wing's properties. I only know of
the property trees with a property called `mdl` right now, so the FX slots, the
GATE slots, EQ slots, etc... are tested in this way. If you find other
properties that are dynamic in nature, please post a Github issue or offer up a
pull request to **wingschema** to fix this.

Note that you will mess up your Wing properties if you run with `**wingschema**
-modify`. Do a snapshot save of your Wing before running `**wingschema**
-modify` and restore it afterwards.

If you don't pass `-modify`, **wingschema** will only request the properties as
they are seen the time of the request.

If you find that your property is missing, load it up and run **wingschema**
again or use the `-modify` flag to get them all.


## wingprop utility

**wingprop** can be run with zero arguments to get help. It can do the following tasks:

- get a property value
- set a property value
- get a property schema

It also has an option to output as JSON.

## wingschema utility

**wingschema** will request every property schema and save them to two files.
As of firmware 3.0.5, there are over 78,000 entries. See above about more
information about the two files as well as how you can use this to update the
proper map in the library. Also, see above about the `-modify` flag.

## wingmon utility

**wingmon** is a utility that prints out property changes on your Wing. Just
run it with no arguments (it'll discover the Wing on the network for you). Walk
over to your Wing and touch a button or move a fader. You can also use the Wing
apps to change properties. You'll see all the things that changed printed to
the console.


# Protocols

There are 3 protocols available for controlling the Wing:

- The Native protocol
- The [OSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) protocol
- The [Discovery protocol](Discovery.md)

The Native and OSC protocols (and much much more) are documented
[here](https://cdn.mediavalet.com/aunsw/musictribe/mzolJdOzu0WZG59pX2LDkA/drJQVBUjakq76Xn2GcaT0Q/Original/WING%20Remote%20Protocols%20v3.0.5.pdf)
(as of Wing firmware v3.0.5) by [Patrick-Gilles Maillot](https://github.com/pmaillot). He's also created a few other utilites for the Wing.
A copy of that document is checked in to
this repo just in case the above link is not available. The file is called
[Wing-Remote-Protocols.pdf](Wing-Remote-Protocols.pdf).

The Wing's Native protocol is a binary protocol that is more efficient and reliable
than OSC. It is the protocol used by all the Behringer Wing apps to communicate
with the Wing.

**libwing** implements the Native protocol and the Discovery protocol.

**libwing** does not implement the OSC protocol, but there are many other
libraries available that do support OSC.
