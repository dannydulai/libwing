This library includes a very large mapping of property names and property ids.
It's over 35k entries and adds about 1MB to your binarry. It also slightly
slows down the startup of the library (a few milliseconds on a modern CPU).

The Behringer Wing's native protocol only really deals with ids, so if you ever
want to print a property name or look up a property id by name, you need this
mapping. If you are happy to hard code the ids in your usage and never need to
print the names, you can disable this mapping feature.

This mapping can be generated by running the `wingschema` tool. This will
create propmap.rs and propmap.jsonl. propmap.rs is built into the library, and
the jsonl file is for your reference.

If you want a minimal mapping of name -> id built into the code, you can copy
empty-propmap.rs over the propmap.rs included.

The propmap.rs included in this repo was generated from a Wing Compact running
3.0.5 firmware.
